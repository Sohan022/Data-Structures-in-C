# Chaining

## Problem Description

Take a positive integer (say N) from user. Generate N unique numbers (positive integers only). Take another positive integer (say M) from user. Insert N integers into a hash table of size M with collisions resolved by chaining. Let the hash function be h(k) = k mod M where k is the integer which you want to insert. Calculate the following:

(a) Total number of collisions during insertion of all the integers in the table.

(b) After inserting all the integers in the hash table, the size of the linked list corresponding to each cell of the Hash table.
