# Sort

## Problem Description

**Sort an array of n elements (generate the elements randomly) in non-deceasing order using the following algorithms:**

(a) Bubble sort 

(b) Selection sort

(c) Insertion sort 

(d) Quick sort

(e) Merge sort

**Run your code for n (array size) = 10, 100, 10000, 100000 and 10000000. Report the followings after sorting:**

(a) Running time of the algorithms. 

(b) Number of comparisons in each algorithm. 

(c) Number of swapping required in each algorithm. 

(d) Print the sorted array after applying each sorting algorithm.
